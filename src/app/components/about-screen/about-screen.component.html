        <div class="history-content">
            <p>In the summer of 2020, Dina Zakaria, Ashley van der Does, Victoria Mei, Anjali Massand, and Caitlin Lambert formed and created Acorn Resources, an educational resource repository. The project stemmed from the Citi WIT 10-week summer internship program. The goal of the 10-week internship was to create a computing solution to a problem relating to the current increase in remote work or learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because all members of the team were college students who had experienced learning online the past semester, we decided to focus on the aspect of remote learning. After comparing our individual problems with remote learning and taking survey responses from our peers, the team decided to create Acorn Resources, a simple resource repository that would allow both students and professors to access files, videos, and questions in an organized manner. With Acorn, professors are still able to organize their resources based on how they prefer to organize their course, but the simplicity of the site allows students to expect where to find resources, rather than be confused from professor to professor. We hope to enhance remote learning for everyone involved in the classroom.</p>
